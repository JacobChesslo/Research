This is the first iteration of what's to come of a larger project of gridcard and gridpack automation for MC Requests in CERN's cms MC central requests

1) The cms/genproductions should be placed here in some regard from the cms github https://github.com/cms-sw/genproductions
2) Place these in genproductions/bin/MadGraph5_aMCatNLO
3) Run the scrip Gridpack.sh (it's helpful to use a screen on lxlplus cause it can take a while)
